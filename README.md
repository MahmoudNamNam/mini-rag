## 🧭 Project Goal

Accelerate legal contract reviews by:

* Structuring critical data (terms, dates, obligations) from unstructured documents
* Simplifying review workflows through intelligent UI + AI
* Enabling traceability, compliance, and collaboration for legal teams

## 👨‍💻 My Role

As the **Machine Learning and Backend Engineer**, I am responsible for:

* ✅ Designing and training models for clause classification, summarization, and risk detection
* ✅ Developing and maintaining the FastAPI backend for document ingestion, ML inference, and feedback collection
* 🛠 Currently working on:

  * Fine-tuning legal-specific transformer models
  * Building APIs to support real-time frontend interaction
  * Structuring a modular, scalable ML service architecture
